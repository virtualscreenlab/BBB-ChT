This study investigated the blood‒brain barrier (BBB) permeability of the central nervous system (CNS)-active compounds donepezil (DON), methionine (MET), and memantine (MEM) by employing a comprehensive in silico approach. Rigid-flexible molecular docking simulations indicated favorable binding affinities of all the compounds with BBB-ChT. Notably, DON exhibited the highest binding affinity (ΔGbind = -10.26 kcal/mol), which was predominantly mediated by significant hydrophobic interactions. In silico kinetic profiling suggested the stability of the DON/BBB-ChT complex, with ligand release prompted by conformational changes. 3D molecular alignment corroborated a minor conformational shift for DON in its minimal binding energy pose. Predictions indicated that active transport mechanisms notably enhance the brain distribution of donepezil compared to that of MET and MEM. These findings highlight the potential of donepezil for superior BBB penetration, primarily through active transport mechanisms, underscoring the need for further validation through in vitro and in vivo studies.
